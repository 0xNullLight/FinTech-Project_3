Spent a few days doing this at first. I wanted to hook up **Bittensor's Neural Internet**'s Image Generator to the project since I believe this is better than mid-journey & OpenAI's Dalle and it's free, but due to complications of having to constantly update the **discord token**, we decided not to go this route and use OpenAI's Dalle 3 instead. However, I'mma leave this code here because I still think it was a important contributing factor in my understanding of how these bots work exspecially on discord.
